# Thermal Management & Scaling (Mars/Vacuum Habitats)

- Passive baseline: Diamond-CVD coating + 6-face conduction → lattice as shared heatsink
- Burst mode: Gd magnetocaloric layer (zero hold power) absorbs spike heat
- No active pumps/fluids → zero-maintenance in radiation-heavy environments
- 1000 cubes / 1m³: ~7–19 kW aggregate, managed via duty cycle + radiative panels
- Vacuum bonus: No convection loss → pure conduction/radiation control

Sims & calcs incoming.
