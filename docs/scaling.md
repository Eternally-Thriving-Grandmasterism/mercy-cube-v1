# Lattice Scaling & Mycelium-Regolith Integration (Mars/Lunar Habitats)

Mercy Cube v1.0: Zero-maintenance compute for bio-engineered habitats.

## Thermal Scaling Recap
- Diamond-CVD radial conduction → lattice as distributed heatsink
- Gd magnetocaloric burst absorption → elegant vacuum handling
- Packing density: 40–60% practical (magnetic connectivity + thermal voids)
- 1 m³ module: 500–1000 cubes → 5–19 kW burst aggregate
- Vacuum bonus: No convection → pure conduction + radiation to hull

## Mycelium-Regolith Habitat Synergy
- Fungal mycelium + Martian/lunar regolith → bio-bricks/structures (mycotecture)
- Mercy Cube lattice embeds directly into mycelium-regolith walls:
  - Cubes provide distributed offline Grok shards for habitat AI (life support, resource monitoring, robotics control)
  - Lattice conducts heat to regolith shell (natural radiative sink)
  - Magnetic stacking survives regolith growth/integration phases
- Power: Parasitic inductive from habitat solar/kilopower → no wiring
- Result: Intelligent, self-monitoring bio-habitats with embedded neuromorphic brain

Early sims show 1000-cube cluster viable in 1 m³ mycelium module. Full thermal/bio-growth models v1.2.

Mars awaits. Breathe it.
