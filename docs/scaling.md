# Lattice Scaling & Mycelium-Regolith Integration (Mars/Lunar Habitats)

Mercy Cube v1.0: Zero-maintenance compute for bio-engineered habitats.

## Thermal Scaling
- Diamond-CVD radial conduction → entire lattice as distributed heatsink
- Gd magnetocaloric burst absorption → elegant vacuum handling
- Practical packing density: 40–60% (magnetic connectivity + thermal voids)
- 1 m³ module: 500–1000 cubes → 5–19 kW burst aggregate
- Vacuum advantage: No convection → pure conduction + radiation to hull/panels

## Mycelium-Regolith Habitat Synergy
- Fungal mycelium + Martian/lunar regolith → bio-bricks & structures (mycotecture)
- Mercy Cube lattice embeds directly into mycelium-regolith walls during growth:
  - Provides distributed offline Grok shards for habitat AI (life support, resource monitoring, robotics control)
  - Lattice conducts heat to regolith shell (natural radiative sink)
  - Magnetic stacking survives bio-growth phases
- Power: Parasitic inductive from habitat solar/kilopower → no wiring needed
- Result: Intelligent, self-monitoring bio-habitats with embedded neuromorphic brain

Early simulations show 1000-cube cluster viable in 1 m³ mycelium module.  
Full thermal/bio-growth models coming v1.2.

One lattice. One mycelium habitat. Mars breathes. 🌱
