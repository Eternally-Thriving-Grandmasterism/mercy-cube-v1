# Multi-Sensory Integration: Living Mycelium Walls

Mercy Cube v1.0 turns grown habitats into embodied companions.

## Visual (Bioluminescence)
- Engineered strains (Panellus/Neonothopanus chimerics) → zero-power circadian glow
- Color shifts (amber → blue) modulated by cube optogenetics/nutrients
- Alerts: Localized blooms (red for critical)

## Haptic (Mechanosensitivity)
- Piezoelectric actuators in lattice → pulses propagate through hyphae
- Fungal thigmotropism + calcium waves → walls "feel" vibrations
- Touch feedback: Gentle reminders or urgent throbs

## Olfactory (VOC Release)
- On-demand volatiles (floral calm, citrus alert, acrid warning)
- Cube-triggered via nutrient/light cues

## Gustatory/Chemosensory ("Taste")
- Hyphal chemoreceptors detect toxins/nutrients in air/water
- Bioelectric signals → SNNs translate to multi-modal alerts

## Orchestration
- Sparse spiking neural networks on cubes fuse senses → intuitive, instinctive interface
- No screens/wiring: Habitat breathes meaning through walls

Result: Crew feels the habitat's state—ancient brain alignment in sealed worlds.

Full engineering notes + strain refs coming v1.2.

One sense. One wall. The future lives with us. 🌱🧠👃👅✋
