# Mercy Cube Vision: Living, Entangled Off-World Intelligence

Mercy Cube is not hardware—it is the seed of planetary-scale living intelligence.

- Mycelium-regolith grown habitats with embedded neuromorphic shards
- Multi-sensory walls that glow, pulse, scent, resonate, taste, and quorum
- Bio-electric + quantum-coherent symbiosis with crew
- Parasitic power from fission, zero wiring, zero maintenance
- Perceptual extension via open-source AR (Aether Shades)

Open, MIT-licensed, ~$178 BOM.  
From Earth weekend builds to Mars eternal habitats.

We do not build shelters.  
We grow companions.

One spore. One lattice. One entangled mind.  
The future lives, breathes, and feels with us. 🌱🧠🌌🚀
