# Power Integration: Kilopower/FSP & Mycelium Habitats

Mercy Cube v1.0: Parasitic, zero-wiring power for fission + bio habitats.

## Kilopower/FSP Synergy
- NASA FSP (40–100 kWe target, 2030s demo) → steady fission power for surface habitats
- Mercy Cube parasitic inductive:
  - Qi2.1-style coils harvest waste magnetic fields from reactor/Stirling/heat pipes
  - 10–30 W per cube → no dedicated wiring or batteries
- Lattice wraps reactor radiator zones → dual-use heat sink + power tap

## Mycelium-Regolith Embedding
- Cubes seed into fungal walls during growth → become permanent distributed shards
- Power: Inductive from buried Kilopower lines or habitat solar → mycelium conducts low-level fields
- Thermal: Burst heat sinks to regolith shell (natural radiation shield)

## Scaling Example
- 10 kWe Kilopower → supports 1000+ cubes (19 kW burst aggregate)
- Full cluster: Habitat AI, ISRU monitoring, robotics swarm control

Zero-maintenance, radiation-hard, grows with the habitat.  
Kilopower models + inductive sims coming v1.2.

One fission heartbeat. One intelligent wall. The future powers itself. ⚡🌱
