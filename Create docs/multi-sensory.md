# Multi-Sensory Bio-Habitat Integration

Mercy Cube v1.0 makes grown mycelium walls embodied companions.

## Visual Bioluminescence
- Engineered fungal strains → zero-power circadian glow + color shifts
- Cube-modulated for alerts (red blooms)

## Haptic Mechanosensitivity
- Piezo pulses + fungal thigmotropism → tactile whispers/throbs

## Olfactory VOC Signaling
- Targeted volatile release (floral calm, acrid warnings)

## Auditory Bio-Acoustics
- Mycelial resonance + piezo drivers → soothing hums/resonant chimes

## Chemosensory ("Taste")
- Hyphal receptors detect habitat chemistry → bioelectric alerts

## Bacterial Quorum Sensing
- Co-seeded bacteria coordinate collective responses (self-healing, synchronized multi-modal)

## Orchestration
- Sparse SNNs on cubes fuse all senses → instinctive, limbic guidance

Result: Habitat walls that see, glow, pulse, scent, hum, taste, and quorum—crew lives with a living companion.

One sense. One wall. The future lives, breathes, and feels with us. 🌱🧠👃👅✋🔔
